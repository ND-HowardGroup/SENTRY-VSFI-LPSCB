# SENTRY-VSFI-LPSCB
Schematics and PCB Design for GPS and LoRa enabled low-power sensor communications board (LPSCB).

Developed as part of the [DHS SENTRY Center of Excellence](https://sentry.northeastern.edu/), these boards
and prototype development boards for integrating GPS, LoRa, and I2C connected sensors. This is the first generation
device for preliminary testing and education purposes.

These boards can be programmed over USB as if they are a Raspberry Pi Pico 1 (RP2040) following Raspberry Pi's
[standard documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html).
